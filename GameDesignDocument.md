# Objectives

Master the combat system of the game, as well as the unique abilities of each characters. Work your way up from the easiest difficulty, or challenge yourself by diving into the hardest difficulty.

# Mechanics
# Actions

## Combat

### Abilities

Each character has a set of offensive abilities and a defensive ability. Triggering these abilities are done by performing a specific sequence of inputs during your turn. Multiple abilities can be triggered during a turn. If a player succeeds to perform a defensive ability, any incoming attacks during the opponent's turn is blocked and will not deal damage.

### Turn-based

Your turn consists of a window of time in which you can perform a sequence of inputs to trigger abilities. Once this window expires, any correct sequence that are recognised, its corresponding ability will be put on action. The turn then goes to the enemy, and this process is repeated until either the player or the enemy's HP drops to zero.

This can be accessed in the main menu as well as during the game when it is paused.
